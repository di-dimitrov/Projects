# Project Description

This project is a simple mini-game implemented on javascript with HTML5 and CSS.
The goal of the game is to train your visual memory.
You start the game and get a X amount of numbers(depends on chosen difficulty) and random X numbers appear 
for 1 second(also depends on difficulty) and you have to then try to input the same numbers as answers.

The project is not complete as far as the visual side of it goes. However the game itself works.
